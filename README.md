# Eye-Movement
## Description of project
This is a project that contains to eyes inside the webpage. These eyes are made absolutely by CSS - they are not ready images that are used - . When you move your mouse the eyes are moving in relationship with the location of your mouse. All inside the code are native, there is no use of ready templates.
## How to Run
If you want to run this project you can just open the HTML file in a browser. Then, you just move the mouse and you are going to see that the movement of the eyes follows the movement of the mouse.
## Roadmap of future improvements
This is a project with a specific character, the only thing it does is the motivation of the eyes in relationship with the mouse position. What I might do in the future is to create something like face with these eyes and have this kind of eyes movement inside the face.
